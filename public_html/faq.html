							<b>When I try to announce, I get 'ensure you have forwarded port xxxxx'.</b>
							<br>
							This error gets returned if siad is unable to connect to itself over the internet.
							Most of the time, this means that you have not forwarded your ports.
							You may also see this error if you are behind a firewall or are using some kind of VPN.
							If you are unsure how to forward your ports, check out <a href="http://portforward.com">portforward.com</a>, a site that can help you forward your port.
							Most of the time, forwarding your ports is easy, you just have to see how to do it the first time.
							Sia's default ports are 9981 and 9982.
							If you are using the default ports, please forward both of those ports.
							<br><br>
							<b>Is the miner pointing to the right address?</b>
							<br>
							If your miner is able to fetch blocks, then it is also mining to the right address.
							Sia discourages address use, and handles most of the address management behind the scenes.
							All addresses (including hidden addresses) are stored in the 'wallet.dat' file.
							<br><br>
							<b>Where can I buy and sell siacoins?</b>
							<br>
							Sia is not currently on any altcoin exchanges, though we have reached out to a few and hope to be on some exchanges soon.
							There is a siacoin trading thread at bitcointalk: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1083781.0">/bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1083781.0</a>
