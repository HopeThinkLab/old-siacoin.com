							<b>What are siafunds?</b>
							<br>
							Siafunds are a secondary currency in Sia.
							There are, and always will be, exactly 10,000 siafunds.
							Every time that someone spends coins on a storage contract, everyone holding siafunds will get a small fee.
							Each siafund gets 0.000039% of the coins spent on storage contracts, which means every storage contract has a 3.9% total fee.
							Fees only apply to successful storage contracts, and not to standard transactions or failed storage contracts.
							<br><br>
							<b>How do I get siafunds?</b>
							<br>
							You get siafunds in the same way you get siacoins: someone sends them to you in a transaction.
							Until June 1st, 2015, you can also get them by acquiring Sianotes on the Nxt Asset Exchange and following the redemption process explained on the <a href="sianotes.html">sianotes page â†’</a>.
							<br><br>
							<b>How do I get the siacoins earned by my siafunds?</b>
							<br>
							Over time, siafunds will store up siacoins.
							You can access these siacoins at any time by making a transaction sending these coins to a spendable address.
							The siacoins are not spendable until you make that transaction.
							<br><br>
							<b>Why can't I see siafunds in the wallet?</b>
							<br>
							The beta wallet doesn't recognize siafunds.
							We are adding that functionality with high priority, and there should by a way to view your siafunds when we launch on June 7th.
							<br><br>
							<b>Why is there a fee on host income?</b>
							<br>
							Sia is first and foremost a business, and this fee is our source of income.
							Unlike other cryptocurrency businesses, Sia does not get profits through premining the primary currency.
							Instead, we take fees from the network that go directly to the owners of Siafunds.
							This serves multiple purposes.
							The first is that initially, there was no money to fund developers.
							By selling Siafunds, we were able to raise enough money to work on Sia full time.
							The second reason is that it gives us a huge income to have a large development force behind Sia.
							By giving the Sia team a huge development fund, we will be able to stay cutting edge and be aggressive with our development and marketing.
							Sia's goal is to replace all centralized cloud storage, and that's going to take a lot of money.
							By taking a non-crippling fee (3.9%), we can fund dozens or potentially hundreds of full time developers and have a marketing budget.
							We fully intend to use Sia as an enterprise product, the same way that Amazon uses S3 as an enterprise product.
